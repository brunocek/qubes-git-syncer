# qubes-git-syncer (Qubes sync git repositories with dom0)

This project is a pointer to codeberg where we collaborate and develop this: https://codeberg.org/brunoschroeder/qubes-git-syncer

As seen on: (https://codeberg.org/brunoschroeder/qubes-git-syncer.git)

This solution is intended have git repos easily in sync with dom0.

The initial motivation is to reduce the toil on the development of SaltStack/Jinja states for Qubes.

The solution consists of a bash file (`dom0-syncer.sh` - a lib) with a function. It should be added somewhere in the project. 

On project root, the user should create one (or two) bash script "sourcing the lib" (bash's "importing") and calling the function (described in Suggested Usage).

Similar effort by **solene**:

## Under the hood

To sync a git repo **from** dom0 to vm:

```
git bundle create $DOM0DIRPATH/$FILENAME --all
sudo qvm-move-to-vm $VM_NAME $DOM0DIRPATH/$FILENAME
```

To sync a git repo **to** dom0:

```
sudo qvm-run --pass $VM_NAME 'cd ${VMPATH} && git bundle create - --all ' > $DOM0DIRPATH/$FILENAME
```

## Suggested Installation

On the VM where the project lives:

1. Have it in somewhere in the project. 
2. Also have on the project root, some bash script to call it (described on the next session - Suggested Usages).
3. git add and git commit all changes

On dom0:
1. Bring the project in home executing the bellow commands (substitute the bash variables (after`$` with actual text of where you have the files):

```
sudo qvm-run --pass $VM_NAME 'cd ${VM_PATH_TO_PROJECT} && git bundle create - --all ' > $DOM0DIRPATH/$FILENAME

cd ${DOM0_PATH_TO_GIT_CLONE_PROJECT}

git clone ${DOM0_PATH_TO_GIT_CLONE_PROJECT}/$FILENAME

```

Voil√†, it's installed. From now on, just call your own script that lives on root and you created according to the next session (Suggested Usages). 


## Suggested Usage

On the root of your project, have a bash script to make the sync more convenient, e.g.i for a project on `~/bkp/conf-salt` and `dom0-syncer.sh` at `lib/`:

```
#!/bin/bash
# GNU GPL v3+, Bruno Schroeder
# https://codeberg.org/brunoschroeder/qubes-git-syncer

# convention: `LIB_PATH` (the path where `dom0-syncer.sh` lives, and it is the same for dom0 and VM - e.g. `~/src/project/lib/`)
LIB_PATH="~/bkp/conf-salt/lib/"

# `DOM0DIRPATH` (base path for pack files in dom0)
DOM0DIRPATH="~/bkp/in-out"

PACK_NAME="git-conf-salt.pack"

# `VMPATH` (project path in the VM)
VMPATH="/home/user/bkp/conf-salt"

# body
source ${LIB_PATH}/dom0-syncer.sh

if [ -z $1 ] || [ -z $2 ]; then
	echo "usage: bash sync.sh <direction> <vm_name>"
	echo -e "\t direction\t\t Either F (from dom0 to vm) or T (to dom0)."
	echo -e "\t vm_name\t\t Name of the VM."
	exit
fi
DIRECTION=$1 ; VM=$2

echo "Be sure to have commited all changes and have HEAD in place."
read T
dom0-sync ${DIRECTION} ${VM} ${DOM0DIRPATH} ${PACK_NAME} ${VMPATH}

git status

echo "`git reset --hard && pull` ? (Hit Enter to continue or Ctrl+c not to.)"
read T

git reset --hard

git pull ${DOM0DIRPATH}/${PACK_NAME}


```

One could have a script to sync on each direction. That would make it even more straightforward.

### Attention

1. Attention, it might be better to have all commits made and HEAD in place.
1. When moving from dom0, it might be better to have all commits made and HEAD in place.

## Code for github

This project is a pointer to codeberg where we collaborate and develop this, and the code can be fetched: https://codeberg.org/brunoschroeder/qubes-git-syncer

But if you're in github and lazy to switch, here goes `dom0syncer.sh` :

```

        echo -e "\t direction\t\t Either F (from dom0 to vm) or T (to dom0)."
        echo -e "\t vm_name\t\t Name of the VM."
        echo -e "\t dom0dirpath\t\t Path to directory where git bundle pack file will be created."
        echo -e "\t file_name\t\t Name of the git bundle pack file to be createad."
		echo -e "\t vm_path\t\t (optional) Path on the VM to create the git bundle pack file.\n"
	exit
    fi
